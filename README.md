# TripSorter

#### Introduction
You are given a stack of boarding cards for various transportations that will take you from a point
A to point B via several stops on the way. All of the boarding cards are out of order and you don't
know where your journey starts, nor where it ends. Each boarding card contains information
about seat assignment, and means of transportation (such as flight number, bus number etc).
Write an API that lets you sort this kind of list and present back a description of how to complete
your journey.

#### Setup
